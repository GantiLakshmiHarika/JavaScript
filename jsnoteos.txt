Datatypes in js:
1. Primitive data types  
 Primitive data are the most basic data types. They store single values and are immutable (cannot be changed).
number → Represents numeric values (e.g., 10, 3.14).
string → Represents textual data (e.g., "hello", 'world').
boolean → Represents logical values (true or false).
null → Represents an intentional absence of value.
undefined → Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
bigint → Used to represent large integers beyond the range of number.
symbol → Represents a unique and immutable identifier.

2. Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive data types are complex types. They can hold multiple values and are mutable.
object → Used to store collections of data in key-value pairs.
(e.g., { name: "John", age: 25 })

Any thing that enclosed with in single quatation,double quation or backtrick is consider as string
