->  Basic theory of java script :
Inventor: Brendan Eich (1995) at Netscape.
Type: Interpreted, High-level, Lightweight scripting language.
Engine:V8 (Google Chrome) → compiles JS to machine code.
Other engines: SpiderMonkey (Firefox), Chakra (Edge), JavaScriptCore (Safari).
Standardization: ECMAScript (by ECMA International).
Popular Name: JS (JavaScript).
Initial Names:Mocha → LiveScript → JavaScript.
Execution: Runs inside browser + also outside (Node.js).
Features:Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

 TIP 1: 
To get emojis in the output : press windows button and ; button we get emojis click on emoji u need.
windows+; = emoji hey done macha i got.

-> understanding about console.log() why we use it ?

in js every thing is  a object 
99% objects  1% primitives
whom Asking - object
what asking - method
quantity- aruguments
console is one of the object in js 
alert is a global object 

Tip : shift+enter to move to new line in the console .
alert method is used provide a pop up notification

Datatypes in js:
1. Primitive data types  
 Primitive data are the most basic data types. They store single values and are immutable (cannot be changed).
number → Represents numeric values (e.g., 10, 3.14).
string → Represents textual data (e.g., "hello", 'world').
boolean → Represents logical values (true or false).
null → Represents an intentional absence of value.
undefined → Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
bigint → Used to represent large integers beyond the range of number.
symbol → Represents a unique and immutable identifier.

2. Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive data types are complex types. They can hold multiple values and are mutable.
object → Used to store collections of data in key-value pairs.
(e.g., { name: "John", age: 25 })

Any thing that enclosed with in single quatation,double quation or backtrick is consider as string 
" my name is harika"  yes
"185" yes even though it is a number it is enclosed with in the double quatation it is consider as string in java script.

Tip : console.log( "iam\n learning\n from youtube\n javascript");
      console.log( `iam learning from youtube javascript`);
     \n for new line and also ` operator is used for newline in js 
     ctrl z- undo
     ctrl c -copy
     ctrl v - paste
     ctrl x- delete
     ctrl a - select all

-> List of Common Escape Sequences
Code                	Description

\b	                    Backspace (moves cursor one step back)
\f	                    Form feed (new page, rarely used today)
\n	                    New line (moves cursor to the next line)
\t	                    Horizontal tab (adds a tab space)
\v                   	Vertical tab (rarely used)
\r	                    Carriage return (moves cursor to the beginning of the line)
\\	                    Backslash (\) itself
\' \" \	                Quotes (used to include ', ", or ` inside strings)

-> Variables keywords and identifiers 
How do we create a variable?
In JavaScript, variables are containers used to store data. To create a variable, we use keywords like let, var, or const.
Keywords (Reserved Words)

Keywords are special reserved words in JavaScript that have predefined meanings.
They cannot be used as identifiers (variable or function names).

let → Used to declare block-scoped variables.
var → Used to declare function-scoped variables (old way).
const → Used to declare constants (values cannot be reassigned).
function → Used to declare functions.
class → Used to define classes.
if, else, switch → Used for decision-making.

example of let : 
let ramuamount = 2000;
let somuamount = 3000;
let totalamount = ramuamount + somuamount;
console.log(`ramu's amount`,ramuamount);
console.log(`somu's amount`,somuamount);
console.log(`totalamount`,totalamount);
output :ramu's amount 2000
somu's amount 3000
totalamount 5000

identifiers names can be used as reserved words /keywords
variables are used to store the values .

comaparsion of var ,let, const :

const :value cannot be reaasigned any value when we use const
  ramumount=5000
if we use  as const ramuamount = 5000 cannot be change the value 5000 forever if we use const  

var : redeclare of a variable 
example : var marks =80; 
          var marks = 40;

let : cannot redeclare the variable
example : let marks =80; 
          let marks = 40; // no we cannot done like this  

statement: stmt is a instruction which is executed by the js .
js uses automatic  ASI(Automatic semi colon insertion ) 

Expressions and literals :
expression is a piece of code which produces a value when evaluated .
Expression :
total amount = let totalamount = ramuamount + somuamount;
returns value when executed so expression  

literals is a fixed value written directlyin a word eg string number arrays object 
example : literals
let ramuamount = 2000;
let somuamount = 3000;
every literal is an expression.
